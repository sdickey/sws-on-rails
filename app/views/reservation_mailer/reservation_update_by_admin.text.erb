We're happy to say that we currently have availability for your reservation
request with the start date of <%= @reservation.depart_date %> and end date of <%= @reservation.return_date %>.

We'll send you an invoice showing the total cost of the scheduled visits. In order for this reservation
to be added to our calendar, we need to receive a 50% deposit. Please understand that another
client may book some or all of the same dates listed in this reservation. If that happens, and we
receive their deposit before yours, they'll be added to the sit calendar and we will no longer be
available to serve you for this reservation.

<% elsif @reservation.availability_confirmed == 'pending' && @reservation.deposit_confirmed == 'yes' %>
We received a deposit for the reservation request with a start date of <%= @reservation.depart_date %>
and end date of <%= @reservation.return_date %>. However, we haven't approved our availability during
these dates.

We'll contact you soon and let you know if we'll be able to provide pet sitting services for this
reservation request.
